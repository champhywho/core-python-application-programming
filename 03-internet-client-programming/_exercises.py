# FTP
# 01. Simple FTP Client. Given the FTP examples from this chapter, write a small
# FTP client program that goes to your favorite Web sites and downloads the
# latest versions of the applications you use. This can be a script that you run
# every few months to ensure that your're using the "latest and greatest." You
# should probably keep some sort of table with FTP location, login, and password
# information for your convenience.

# 02. Simple FTP Client and Pattern-Matching. Use your solution to Exercise 01
# as a sstarting point for creating another simple FTP client that either
# pushes of pulls a set of files from a remote host by using patterns. For
# example, if your want to move a set of Python or PDF files from one host to
# another, allow users to enter *.py or doc*.pdf and only transfer those files
# whose names match.
